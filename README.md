- [video_scores_parser](./video_scores_parser.py): I am a pianist, and scores are pretty expensive, so this will download all different photograms of a YouTube "score video" and assemble the full score (can be improved... whatever)
- I have a parser that creates a full graph showing all the interactions with all the Windows 10 drivers by using the IDA Pro CLI as the binary lifting backend (from my time hacking windows). It is private
- [parsifal](./parsifal.py): a little script based on scrapyFy that downloads EVERYTHING in scope in Immunefi. It is trash, as it was my first version...
- [metaheuristics](./metaheuristics): just some college assignments
  - [search](./metaheuristics/search%20stuff): local search, tabu and grasp
  - [genetics](./metaheuristics/genetics): genetics and evolutionary
  - [ants colonies](./metaheuristics/ants%20colonies): the classic one
